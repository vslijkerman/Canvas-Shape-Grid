# Canvas Shape Grid
Object oriented canvas grid to easily place dots and rectangles on an HTML5 canvas grid.

## Usage
Open the site.js file and go to line 73 where it says "Place your objects below.". There are two code examples given here about the syntax of creating a new shape.

### Dot
```javascript
shape = new Dot(0, 0);
shapes.push(shape);
```

### Rectangle
```javascript
shape = new Rect(0, 0);
shapes.push(shape);
```
